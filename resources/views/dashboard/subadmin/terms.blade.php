                   or customers.

                   A Privacy Policy is an important legal document that lets users understand the
                   various ways a website might be collecting personal information. The purpose
                   of a Privacy Policy is to inform users of your data collection practices in order
                   to protect the customer’s privacy.

                   Your Privacy Policy should disclose how the website/app collects information,
                   how the information is used, whether or not it is shared with third parties and
                   how it is protected and stored.

                   There are 3 main reasons for having a Privacy Policy: (1) you’re required by law,
                   (2) you’re required by third party services, (3) you want to be transparent.
